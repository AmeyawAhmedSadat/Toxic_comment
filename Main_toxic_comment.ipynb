    "# Project Title: Toxic Comments Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Team Members\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rakhat Zhussupekov\n",
    "- Sadat Ahmed Ameyaw\n",
    "- Veselina Bulatova\n",
    "- Ahastasiia Kleschevnikova\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Project Description: \n",
    "Online platforms often face challenges in maintaining respectful and productive discussions due to toxic comments, which can include threats, obscenity, insults, and identity-based hate. This project aims to build a machine learning model to identify and classify such toxic comments, helping platforms foster healthier interactions. The initiative builds upon research by the Conversation AI team at Jigsaw and Google, aiming to improve existing toxicity detection models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**These issues often lead to such Business problems**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Online platforms are losing user engagement and participation due to toxic comments\n",
    "- Manual moderation is expensive, slow, and inconsistent\n",
    "- Platforms often resort to shutting down comments entirely, losing community interaction\n",
    "- Existing models (like Perspective API) lack granular toxicity detection.  (only provides a single \"toxicity\" score, treating all forms of toxicity as a single category). This makes it difficult for platforms to selectively moderate different types of toxic content (e.g. allowing profanity but blocking threats) – This was said in the Kaggle description of the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "And the fiancial impact of such problems if not solved include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Financial Impact of the Problem**\n",
    "1.\tDirect Costs: \n",
    "o\tManual moderation staff costs\n",
    "o\tLost advertising revenue from reduced user engagement\n",
    "o\tPlatform maintenance costs for basic moderation tools\n",
    "2.\tIndirect Costs: \n",
    "o\tUser churn due to toxic environment\n",
    "o\tReduced content creation\n",
    "o\tBrand damage from toxic content\n",
    "o\tLegal risks from unmoderated harmful content\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective:\n",
    "The goal is to create a multi-label classification model capable of predicting the probability of various types of toxicity for a given comment. The model should improve upon existing tools, such as the Perspective API, by providing nuanced predictions and reducing errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Source: \n",
    "The dataset is sourced from Wikipedia’s talk page edits and is publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/overview). It includes comments labeled for six types of toxicity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Toxic\n",
    "- Severe toxic\n",
    "- Obscene\n",
    "- Threat\n",
    "- Insult\n",
    "- Identity hat\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset Files:\n",
    "\n",
    "- train.csv: Contains labeled comments for training the model.\n",
    "- test.csv: Unlabeled comments for testing the model predictions.\n",
    "- test_labels.csv: True labels for test data (for evaluation).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset Columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- id: Unique identifier for each comment.\n",
    "- comment_text: Text of the comment.\n",
    "- toxic, severe_toxic, obscene, threat, insult, identity_hate: Binary labels indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of each toxicity type.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scope: This project will involve:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): To understand the dataset distribution and uncover patterns in toxic comments.\n",
    "- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing text data for machine learning.\n",
    "- Model Development: Building and evaluating a multi-label classification model.\n",
    "- Evaluation: Comparing the model's performance against existing benchmarks.\n",
